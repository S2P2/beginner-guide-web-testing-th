### 📖 Content

Congratulations! You have learned the fundamental principles of web test automation and have written your first stable, well-structured tests. The final step is to learn how to run them effectively and know what to learn next.

#### Running Your Tests: Headed vs. Headless

You have two primary ways to run your test suite:

1.  **Headed Mode:** This is what you've been doing so far. A real browser window opens up and you can watch the robot perform its actions. This is perfect for writing and debugging tests.

2.  **Headless Mode:** This is the default for most tools when run from the command line. The exact same test runs, but **no browser window is opened**. The browser runs invisibly in the background. This is much faster and is how tests are run in automated systems like CI/CD pipelines.

**How to Run from the Command Line:**

---
##### <tabs>
<tab label="Playwright">
```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (default)
npx playwright test

# Run all tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed```
</tab>
<tab label="Cypress">
```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode (default)
npx cypress run

# Run all tests in headed mode
npx cypress run --headed
```
</tab>
<tab label="Selenium">
```bash
# Selenium runs are typically initiated via a test runner like Mocha
# To run in headless, you must add the option to your driver configuration
# e.g., new Builder().forBrowser('chrome').setChromeOptions(new Options().headless())

# Run tests with the Mocha command
npx mocha your_test_file.js
```
</tab>
</tabs>

---

After a headless run, you'll want to see the results. Both Playwright and Cypress generate beautiful HTML reports that show you which tests passed or failed, how long they took, and even include screenshots or videos of failed tests.

#### Where to Go Next? Your Learning Path

This course gave you the foundation. Now you can explore the wider world of testing. Here are your next steps:

1.  **Master Your Chosen Tool:** Dive deep into the official documentation of Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium. They have excellent tutorials on more advanced topics.
2.  **Learn about CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment):** This is the practice of running your tests automatically every time a developer pushes new code. Look into tools like **GitHub Actions**, Jenkins, or CircleCI. This is how you provide the real value of automation to your team.
3.  **Explore Other Types of Testing:**
    *   **API Testing:** Instead of testing the UI, you test the underlying API that the front-end talks to. It's much faster and more stable.
    *   **Component Testing:** Test individual UI components (like a date-picker or a search bar) in isolation, without needing to launch the whole application.
    *   **Visual Regression Testing:** Take screenshots of your application and have a tool automatically detect any unintended visual changes (e.g., a button moved 2 pixels to the left).

The world of software testing is vast and rewarding. You now have the skills to start building a safety net that will give your team the confidence to build and release software quickly and reliably. Keep practicing
